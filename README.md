# STEDActinFCN

This is the provided code and examples of the paper [Neuronal activity remodels the F-actin based submembrane lattice in dendrites but not axons of hippocampal neurons](tbt).

The folder `STEDActinDendriteFCN`contains a 2-channel network to predict the presence of F-actin rings and fibers on dendrites, while the folder `STEDActinAxonFCN` contains a 1-channel network that predicts the presence of F-actin rings on axons.
